   Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more.
   Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things.
   Spending time in nature also inspires a sense of awe.
   This feeling that the world is so much bigger than you can comprehend leads to “expansive thinking,” which allows us to consider different perspectives and can lead to innovative ideas.</textarea></br>
